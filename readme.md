### Hello, this is am experiment in hopes to achieve a 'smooth' ('auto'/step-wise) voice leading functionality to chord generation. Transitioning from chord to chord should yield dynamic voicings and harmony based on the relationship between the new and prior chord; this is in contrast to operating only within parallel motion (ie. only building chords off pre-determined / provided chord-frequency data structures). End goal will be to implement this in some capacity with [metrOhgnome's](https://github.com/jacoblauxman/da-metrOhgnome) [chord generator](https://metrohgnome.vercel.app/chords).

Run ```node index.js``` + whatever chords desired as individual args,  case-inclusive note "names" + common symbols used (such as 'C', 'Cmaj', 'Cm', 'Cmin', 'C-', 'Caug', 'C+', 'Cdim', 'CÃ¸')
